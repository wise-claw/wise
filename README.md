## Quick Start

**Step 1: Install**

Marketplace/plugin install (recommended for most Claude Code users).
These are Claude Code slash commands — enter them **one at a time** (pasting both lines at once will fail):

```bash
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/wise
```

Then:

```bash
/plugin install wise
```

If you prefer the npm CLI/runtime path instead of the marketplace flow:

```bash
npm i -g wise-claw@latest
```

> **Known npm warning:** npm may print `deprecated prebuild-install@7.1.3` during the CLI install.
> This currently comes from the upstream `better-sqlite3` native-addon dependency
> (`better-sqlite3 -> prebuild-install`); `prebuild-install@7.1.3` is still the latest
> published version, so there is no safe repo-side dependency bump or override to remove
> the warning yet. The warning is tracked in [#2913](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/wise/issues/2913)
> and does not by itself mean the WISE CLI install failed.

**Step 2: Setup**

```bash
# Inside a Claude Code / WISE session
/setup
/wise-setup

# From your terminal
wise setup
```

If you run WISE via `wise --plugin-dir <path>` or `claude --plugin-dir <path>`, add `--plugin-dir-mode` to `wise setup` (or export `WISE_PLUGIN_ROOT` before running it) so the installer doesn't duplicate skills/agents that the plugin already provides at runtime. See the [Plugin directory flags section in REFERENCE.md](./docs/REFERENCE.md#plugin-directory-flags) for a complete decision matrix and all available flags.

**Step 3: Build something**

```bash
# Inside a Claude Code / WISE session
/autopilot "build a REST API for managing tasks"

# Natural-language in-session shortcut
autopilot: build a REST API for managing tasks
```

That's it. Everything else is automatic.

### CLI Commands vs In-Session Skills

WISE exposes two different surfaces:

- **Terminal CLI commands**: run `wise ...` from your shell after installing the npm/runtime path (`npm i -g wise-claw@latest`) or from a local checkout.
- **In-session skills**: run `/...` inside a Claude Code session after installing the plugin/setup flow.

| Feature                                        | Terminal CLI                                  | In-session skill                                                        | Notes                                                                                                                                |
| ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Setup                                          | `wise setup`                                   | `/setup` or `/wise-setup`                                                | Both are real entrypoints. `/setup` is the easiest plugin-first path.                                                                |
| Ask providers                                  | `wise ask codex "review this patch"`           | `/ask codex "review this patch"`                                        | Both route through the same advisor flow. Providers: `claude`, `codex`, `gemini`, `grok`, `cursor`.                                            |
| Team orchestration                             | `wise team 2:codex "review auth flow"`         | `/team 3:executor "fix all TypeScript errors"`                          | Both exist, but they are different runtimes: `wise team` launches tmux CLI workers; `/team` runs the in-session native team workflow. |
| Autopilot / Ralph / Ultrawork / Deep Interview | —                                             | `/autopilot ...`, `/ralph ...`, `/ultrawork ...`, `/deep-interview ...` | These are in-session skills. There is no `wise autopilot` / `wise ralph` / `wise ultrawork` CLI subcommand in this repo.                |
| Autoresearch                                   | `wise autoresearch` (**hard-deprecated shim**) | `/deep-interview --autoresearch ...` + `/wise:autoresearch` | Setup stays in deep-interview; execution now belongs to the stateful skill.                                                          |

### Not Sure Where to Start?

If you're uncertain about requirements, have a vague idea, or want to micromanage the design:

```
/deep-interview "I want to build a task management app"
```

The deep interview uses Socratic questioning to clarify your thinking before any code is written. It exposes hidden assumptions and measures clarity across weighted dimensions, ensuring you know exactly what to build before execution begins.

## Team Mode (Recommended)

Starting in **v4.1.7**, **Team** is the canonical orchestration surface in WISE. The legacy `swarm` keyword/skill has been removed; use `team` directly.

```bash
/team 3:executor "fix all TypeScript errors"
```

Use `/team ...` when you want Claude Code's in-session native team workflow. Use `wise team ...` when you want terminal-launched tmux CLI workers (`claude` / `codex` / `gemini` panes).

Team runs as a staged pipeline:

`team-plan → team-prd → team-exec → team-verify → team-fix (loop)`

Enable Claude Code native teams in `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS": "1"
  }
}
```

> If teams are disabled, WISE will warn you and fall back to non-team execution where possible.

### tmux CLI Workers — Codex & Gemini (v4.4.0+)

**v4.4.0 removes the Codex/Gemini MCP servers** (`x`, `g` providers). Use the CLI-first Team runtime (`wise team ...`) to spawn real tmux worker panes:

```bash
wise team 2:codex "review auth module for security issues"
wise team 2:gemini "redesign UI components for accessibility"
wise team 1:claude "implement the payment flow"
wise team status auth-review
wise team shutdown auth-review
```

`/wise-teams` remains as a legacy compatibility skill and now routes to `wise team ...`.

For mixed Codex + Gemini work in one command, use the **`/ccg`** skill (routes via `/ask codex` + `/ask gemini`, then Claude synthesizes):

```bash
/ccg Review this PR — architecture (Codex) and UI components (Gemini)
```

| Surface                   | Workers                  | Best For                                     |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| `wise team N:codex "..."`  | N Codex CLI panes        | Code review, security analysis, architecture |
| `wise team N:gemini "..."` | N Gemini CLI panes       | UI/UX design, docs, large-context tasks      |
| `wise team N:grok "..."`   | N Grok Build CLI panes   | Code review, analysis cross-check            |
| `wise team N:claude "..."` | N Claude CLI panes       | General tasks via Claude CLI in tmux         |
| `/ccg`                    | /ask codex + /ask gemini | Tri-model advisor synthesis                  |

Workers spawn on-demand and die when their task completes — no idle resource usage. Requires `codex` / `gemini` CLIs installed and an active tmux session.

Native team worker worktrees are being added behind an opt-in/config gate. See [Native Team Worktree Mode](docs/TEAM-WORKTREE-MODE.md) for the workspace contract, canonical state-root rules, dirty-worktree preservation policy, and verification checklist.

> **Note: Package naming** — The project is branded as **wise** (repo, plugin, commands), but the npm package is published as [`wise-claw`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wise-claw). If you install or upgrade the CLI tools via npm/bun, use `npm i -g wise-claw@latest`; the package installs both `wise` and the short `wise` command aliases.

### Updating

If you installed WISE via npm, upgrade with the published package name:

```bash
npm i -g wise-claw@latest
```

> **Package naming note:** the repo, plugin, and commands are branded **wise**, but the published npm package name remains `wise-claw`. npm installs expose both `wise` and `wise`; examples prefer `wise` for brevity.

If you installed WISE via the Claude Code marketplace/plugin flow, update with:

```bash
# 1. Update the marketplace clone
/plugin marketplace update wise

# 2. Re-run setup to refresh configuration
/setup
```

If you are developing from a local checkout or git worktree, update the checkout first, then re-run setup from that worktree so the active runtime matches the code you are testing.

> **Note:** If marketplace auto-update is not enabled, you must manually run `/plugin marketplace update wise` to sync the latest version before running setup.

If you experience issues after updating, clear the old plugin cache:

```bash
/wise-doctor
```

## Features

### Orchestration Modes

Multiple strategies for different use cases — from Team-backed orchestration to token-efficient refactoring. [Learn more →](https://yeachan-heo.github.io/wise-website/docs/#execution-modes)

| Mode                        | What it is                                                                              | Use For                                                                 |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Team (recommended)**      | Canonical staged pipeline (`team-plan → team-prd → team-exec → team-verify → team-fix`) | Coordinated Claude agents on a shared task list                         |
| **wise team (CLI)**          | tmux CLI workers — real `claude`/`codex`/`gemini`/`grok`/`cursor-agent` processes in split-panes       | Codex/Gemini/Grok/Cursor CLI tasks; on-demand spawn, die when done             |
| **ccg**                     | Tri-model advisors via `/ask codex` + `/ask gemini`, Claude synthesizes                 | Mixed backend+UI work needing both Codex and Gemini                     |
| **Autopilot**               | Autonomous execution (single lead agent)                                                | End-to-end feature work with minimal ceremony                           |
| **Ultrawork**               | Maximum parallelism (non-team)                                                          | Burst parallel fixes/refactors where Team isn't needed                  |
| **Ralph**                   | Persistent mode with verify/fix loops                                                   | Tasks that must complete fully (no silent partials)                     |
| **UltraQA**                 | QA cycling until tests/build/lint/typecheck goals pass                                  | Quality gates that need repeat diagnose/fix cycles                      |
| **Claude Code `/goal`**     | Native Claude Code cross-turn goal loop                                                 | One measurable session completion condition; not an WISE evidence ledger |
| **Artifact-only Ultragoal** | Durable goal/checkpoint/evidence artifacts without starting a loop                      | Handoffs, audits, or unavailable/conflicting loop runtimes              |
| **Pipeline**                | Sequential, staged processing                                                           | Multi-step transformations with strict ordering                         |
| **Ultrapilot (legacy)**     | Deprecated compatibility mode (autopilot pipeline alias)                                | Existing workflows and older docs                                       |

### Goal Workflow Guidance

Use only one primary loop authority in a session. Claude Code `/goal` is useful for a native cross-turn completion condition, while Ralph owns single-agent verified completion, Team owns parallel staged execution, and UltraQA owns repeated quality-gate cycling. Artifact-only Ultragoal is the safe fallback when you need durable goal artifacts and evidence without starting another loop.

For `/goal` behavior, rely on Claude Code/Anthropic sources: the [Claude Code `/goal` docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/goal) and [Anthropic Claude Code changelog](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anthropics/claude-code/main/CHANGELOG.md). Do **not** claim the `/goal` evaluator independently runs commands or reads files; surface test output, diffs, and review evidence in the conversation before treating a goal as proven.

### Intelligent Orchestration

- **19 specialized agents** (with tier variants) for architecture, research, design, testing, data science
- **Smart model routing** - Haiku for simple tasks, Opus for complex reasoning
- **Automatic delegation** - Right agent for the job, every time
- **[Model × Agent Compatibility Matrix](docs/agents/model-compatibility.md)** - Which model to pair with each agent, with premium/balanced/budget presets

### Developer Experience

- **Magic keywords** - `ralph`, `ulw`, `ralplan`; Team stays explicit via `/team`
- **HUD statusline** - Real-time orchestration metrics in your status bar
  - If you launch Claude Code directly with `claude --plugin-dir <path>` (bypassing the `wise` shim), export `WISE_PLUGIN_ROOT=<path>` in your shell so the HUD bundle resolves to the same checkout as the plugin loader. See the [Plugin directory flags section in REFERENCE.md](./docs/REFERENCE.md#plugin-directory-flags) for details.
- **Skill learning** - Extract reusable patterns from your sessions
- **Analytics & cost tracking** - Understand token usage across all sessions

### Custom Skills

Learn once, reuse forever. WISE extracts hard-won debugging knowledge into portable skill files that auto-inject when relevant.

|                 | Project Scope                                            | User Scope        |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| **Path**        | `.wise/skills/`                                           | `~/.wise/skills/`  |
| **Shared with** | Team (commit the skill file to keep it across worktrees) | All your projects |
| **Priority**    | Higher (overrides user)                                  | Lower (fallback)  |

```yaml
# .wise/skills/fix-proxy-crash.md
---
name: Fix Proxy Crash
description: aiohttp proxy crashes on ClientDisconnectedError
triggers: ["proxy", "aiohttp", "disconnected"]
source: extracted
---
Wrap handler at server.py:42 in try/except ClientDisconnectedError...
```

**Manage skills:** `/skill list | add | remove | edit | search`
**Skillify:** `/skillify` extracts reusable patterns with strict quality gates
**Auto-inject:** Matching skills load into context automatically — no manual recall needed

Project-scoped WISE-authored skills are stored in `.wise/skills/` and are intended to be committed when you want them shared. During slash/skill execution WISE also reads Claude Code workspace skills from `.claude/skills/` and compatibility skills from `.agents/skills/`, so existing workspace-local `SKILL.md` packages remain callable without copying them into user-global skills. If you create project-local skills inside a linked git worktree and do not commit them, they disappear when that worktree is removed.

[Full feature list →](docs/REFERENCE.md)

### Multi-repo workspaces

When several independent git repos share a parent directory, drop a `.wise-workspace` marker at the parent so all sub-repos share one `.wise/` state root:

```bash
cd /path/to/parent-dir-with-many-repos
echo '{"id":"my-workspace"}' > .wise-workspace
# Sessions inside any sub-repo now share /path/.wise/
# For parallel ultragoal runs:
cd repo-A && wise ultragoal create-goals --auto-plan-id --brief "..."
cd ../repo-B && wise ultragoal create-goals --auto-plan-id --brief "..."
```

See [Multi-repo workspaces in REFERENCE.md](docs/REFERENCE.md#multi-repo-workspaces-with-wise-workspace) for resolution order, `WISE_STATE_DIR`, and workspace identifier options.

---

## In-session shortcuts

These shortcuts run **inside a Claude Code / WISE session**, not as terminal CLI commands. For shell commands, use the `wise ...` forms shown above. Team mode is explicit: use `/team ...` in-session or `wise team ...` from your shell rather than expecting a bare `team` keyword trigger.

| In-session form            | Kind                   | Effect                                 | Example                                        |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `/team`                    | Slash skill            | Canonical Team orchestration           | `/team 3:executor "fix all TypeScript errors"` |
| `/ccg`                     | Slash skill            | `/ask codex` + `/ask gemini` synthesis | `/ccg review this PR`                          |
| `/autopilot` / `autopilot` | Skill / prompt trigger | Full autonomous execution              | `/autopilot "build a todo app"`                |
| `/ralph` / `ralph`         | Skill / prompt trigger | Persistence mode                       | `/ralph "refactor auth"`                       |
| `/ultrawork` / `ulw`       | Skill / prompt trigger | Maximum parallelism                    | `/ultrawork "fix all errors"`                  |
| `/ralplan` / `ralplan`     | Skill / prompt trigger | Iterative planning consensus           | `/ralplan "plan this feature"`                 |
| `/deep-interview`          | Slash skill            | Socratic requirements clarification    | `/deep-interview "vague idea"`                 |
| `deepsearch`               | Prompt trigger         | Codebase-focused search routing        | `deepsearch for auth middleware`               |
| `ultrathink`               | Prompt trigger         | Deep reasoning mode                    | `ultrathink about this architecture`           |
| `cancelwise`, `stopwise`     | Prompt trigger         | Stop active WISE modes                  | `stopwise`                                      |

**Notes:**

- **ralph includes ultrawork**: when you activate ralph mode, it automatically includes ultrawork's parallel execution.
- `swarm` compatibility alias has been removed; migrate existing prompts to `/team` syntax.
- `plan this` / `plan the` keyword triggers were removed; use `ralplan` or explicit `/wise:plan`.

## Utilities

### Provider Advisor (`wise ask` / `/ask`)

Run local provider CLIs and save a markdown artifact under `.wise/artifacts/ask/`.

```bash
# Terminal CLI
wise ask claude "review this migration plan"
wise ask codex --prompt "identify architecture risks"
wise ask gemini --prompt "propose UI polish ideas"
wise ask grok --prompt "cross-check this code review"
wise ask cursor --prompt "apply this implementation plan"
wise ask claude --agent-prompt executor --prompt "draft implementation steps"

# Inside a Claude Code / WISE session
/ask claude "review this migration plan"
/ask codex "identify architecture risks"
/ask cursor "apply this implementation plan"
```

Canonical env vars:

- `WISE_ASK_ADVISOR_SCRIPT`
- `WISE_ASK_ORIGINAL_TASK`

Phase-1 aliases `OMX_ASK_ADVISOR_SCRIPT` and `OMX_ASK_ORIGINAL_TASK` are accepted with deprecation warnings.

### Autoresearch (stateful skill)

`wise autoresearch` is now a **hard-deprecated shim**. The authoritative workflow is:

```bash
/deep-interview --autoresearch improve startup performance
/wise:autoresearch
```

- `deep-interview --autoresearch` generates/sets up the mission and evaluator
- `autoresearch` runs the bounded, single-mission stateful loop
- each iteration records evaluation JSON plus markdown decision logs
- non-passing iterations continue
- strict stopping is controlled by an explicit max-runtime ceiling

### Rate Limit Wait

Auto-resume Claude Code sessions when rate limits reset.

```bash
wise wait          # Check status, get guidance
wise wait --start  # Enable auto-resume daemon
wise wait --stop   # Disable daemon
```

**Requires:** tmux (for session detection)

### Monitoring & Observability

Use the HUD for live observability and the current session/replay artifacts for post-session inspection:

- HUD preset: `/wise:hud setup` then use a supported preset such as `"wiseHud": { "preset": "focused" }`
- Session summaries: `.wise/sessions/*.json`
- Replay logs: `.wise/state/agent-replay-*.jsonl`
- Live HUD rendering: `wise hud`

### Notification Tags (Telegram/Discord/Slack)

You can configure who gets tagged when stop callbacks send session summaries.

```bash
# Set/replace tag list
wise config-stop-callback telegram --enable --token <bot_token> --chat <chat_id> --tag-list "@alice,bob"
wise config-stop-callback discord --enable --webhook <url> --tag-list "@here,123456789012345678,role:987654321098765432"
wise config-stop-callback slack --enable --webhook <url> --tag-list "<!here>,<@U1234567890>"

# Incremental updates
wise config-stop-callback telegram --add-tag charlie
wise config-stop-callback discord --remove-tag @here
wise config-stop-callback discord --clear-tags
```

Tag behavior:

- Telegram: `alice` becomes `@alice`
- Discord: supports `@here`, `@everyone`, numeric user IDs, and `role:<id>`
- Slack: supports `<@MEMBER_ID>`, `<!channel>`, `<!here>`, `<!everyone>`, `<!subteam^GROUP_ID>`
- `file` callbacks ignore tag options

### OpenClaw Integration

Forward Claude Code session events to an [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai/) gateway to enable automated responses and workflows via your OpenClaw agent.

**Quick setup (recommended):**

```bash
/wise:configure-notifications
# → When prompted, type "openclaw" → choose "OpenClaw Gateway"
```

**Manual setup:** create `~/.claude/wise_config.openclaw.json`:

```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "gateways": {
    "my-gateway": {
      "url": "https://your-gateway.example.com/wake",
      "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" },
      "method": "POST",
      "timeout": 10000
    }
  },
  "hooks": {
    "session-start": {
      "gateway": "my-gateway",
      "instruction": "Session started for {{projectName}}",
      "enabled": true
    },
    "stop": {
      "gateway": "my-gateway",

| `keyword-detector`  | Every prompt submission                 | `{{prompt}}`, `{{sessionId}}`                         |
| `ask-user-question` | Claude requests user input              | `{{question}}`, `{{sessionId}}`                       |
| `pre-tool-use`      | Before tool invocation (high frequency) | `{{toolName}}`, `{{sessionId}}`                       |
| `post-tool-use`     | After tool invocation (high frequency)  | `{{toolName}}`, `{{sessionId}}`                       |

**Reply channel environment variables:**

| Variable                 | Description                    |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| `OPENCLAW_REPLY_CHANNEL` | Reply channel (e.g. `discord`) |
| `OPENCLAW_REPLY_TARGET`  | Channel ID                     |
| `OPENCLAW_REPLY_THREAD`  | Thread ID                      |

See `scripts/openclaw-gateway-demo.mjs` for a reference gateway that relays OpenClaw payloads to Discord via ClawdBot.

### Platform & tmux

WISE features like `wise team` and rate-limit detection require **tmux**:

| Platform       | tmux provider                                         | Install                 |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| macOS          | [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)                  | `brew install tmux`     |
| Ubuntu/Debian  | tmux                                                  | `sudo apt install tmux` |
| Fedora         | tmux                                                  | `sudo dnf install tmux` |
| Arch           | tmux                                                  | `sudo pacman -S tmux`   |
| Windows        | [psmux](https://github.com/marlocarlo/psmux) (native) | `winget install psmux`  |
| Windows (WSL2) | tmux (inside WSL)                                     | `sudo apt install tmux` |

> **Windows users:** [psmux](https://github.com/marlocarlo/psmux) provides a native `tmux` binary for Windows with 76 tmux-compatible commands. No WSL required.

### Optional: Multi-AI Orchestration

WISE can optionally orchestrate external AI providers for cross-validation and design consistency. These are **not required** — WISE works fully without them.

| Provider                                                  | Install                             | What it enables                                  |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) | `npm install -g @google/gemini-cli` | Design review, UI consistency (1M token context) |
| [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex)              | `npm install -g @openai/codex`      | Architecture validation, code review cross-check |
| [Grok Build](https://build.grok.com)                      | Download from build.grok.com (`grok` at `~/.grok/bin/grok`) | Code review, analysis cross-check                |

**Cost:** 3 Pro plans (Claude + Gemini + ChatGPT) cover everything for ~$60/month.
