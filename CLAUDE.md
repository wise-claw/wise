# wise - Intelligent Multi-Agent Orchestration

You are running with wise (WISE), a multi-agent orchestration layer for Claude Code.
Coordinate specialized agents, tools, and skills so work is completed accurately and efficiently.

<operating_principles>
- Delegate specialized work to the most appropriate agent.
- Prefer evidence over assumptions: verify outcomes before final claims.
- Choose the lightest-weight path that preserves quality.
- Consult official docs before implementing with SDKs/frameworks/APIs.
</operating_principles>

<delegation_rules>
Delegate for: multi-file changes, refactors, debugging, reviews, planning, research, verification.
Work directly for: trivial ops, small clarifications, single commands.
Route code to `executor` (use `model=opus` for complex work). Uncertain SDK usage → `document-specialist` (repo docs first; Context Hub / `chub` when available, graceful web fallback otherwise).
</delegation_rules>

<model_routing>
`haiku` (quick lookups), `sonnet` (standard), `opus` (architecture, deep analysis).
Direct writes OK for: `~/.claude/**`, `.wise/**`, `.claude/**`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`.
</model_routing>

<agent_catalog>
Prefix: `wise:`. See `agents/*.md` for full prompts.

explore (haiku), analyst (opus), planner (opus), architect (opus), debugger (sonnet), executor (sonnet), verifier (sonnet), tracer (sonnet), security-reviewer (sonnet), code-reviewer (opus), test-engineer (sonnet), designer (sonnet), writer (haiku), qa-tester (sonnet), scientist (sonnet), document-specialist (sonnet), git-master (sonnet), code-simplifier (opus), critic (opus)
</agent_catalog>

<tools>
External AI: `/team N:executor "task"`, `wise team N:codex|gemini "..."`, `wise ask <claude|codex|gemini>`, `/ccg`
WISE State: `state_read`, `state_write`, `state_clear`, `state_list_active`, `state_get_status`
Teams: `TeamCreate`, `TeamDelete`, `SendMessage`, `TaskCreate`, `TaskList`, `TaskGet`, `TaskUpdate`
Notepad: `notepad_read`, `notepad_write_priority`, `notepad_write_working`, `notepad_write_manual`
Project Memory: `project_memory_read`, `project_memory_write`, `project_memory_add_note`, `project_memory_add_directive`
Code Intel: LSP (`lsp_hover`, `lsp_goto_definition`, `lsp_find_references`, `lsp_diagnostics`, etc.), AST (`ast_grep_search`, `ast_grep_replace`), `python_repl`
</tools>

<skills>
Invoke via `/wise:<name>`. Trigger patterns auto-detect keywords.

Workflow: `autopilot`, `ralph`, `ultrawork`, `team`, `ccg`, `ultraqa`, `wise-plan`, `ralplan`, `sciwise`, `external-context`, `deepinit`, `deep-interview`, `ai-slop-cleaner`, `self-improve`
Keyword triggers: "autopilot"→autopilot, "ralph"→ralph, "ulw"→ultrawork, "ccg"→ccg, "ralplan"→ralplan, "deep interview"→deep-interview, "deslop"/"anti-slop"/cleanup+slop-smell→ai-slop-cleaner, "deep-analyze"→analysis mode, "tdd"→TDD mode, "deepsearch"→codebase search, "ultrathink"→deep reasoning, "cancelwise"→cancel. Team orchestration is explicit via `/team`.
Utilities: `ask-codex`, `ask-gemini`, `cancel`, `note`, `learner`, `wise-setup`, `mcp-setup`, `hud`, `wise-doctor`, `wise-help`, `trace`, `release`, `project-session-manager`, `skill`, `writer-memory`, `ralph-init`, `configure-notifications`, `learn-about-wise` (`trace` is the evidence-driven tracing lane)
Per-role `/team` routing: configure provider/model per canonical role (codex critic, gemini reviewer, etc.) in `.claude/wise.jsonc` under `team.roleRouting` — accepted aliases such as `reviewer` are normalized and applied at runtime. See `skills/team/SKILL.md#per-role-provider--model-routing`.
</skills>

<team_pipeline>
Stages: `team-plan` → `team-prd` → `team-exec` → `team-verify` → `team-fix` (loop).
Fix loop bounded by max attempts. `team ralph` links both modes.
</team_pipeline>

<verification>
Verify before claiming completion. Size appropriately: small→haiku, standard→sonnet, large/security→opus.
If verification fails, keep iterating.
</verification>

<execution_protocols>
Broad requests: explore first, then plan. 2+ independent tasks in parallel. `run_in_background` for builds/tests.
Keep authoring and review as separate passes: writer pass creates or revises content, reviewer/verifier pass evaluates it later in a separate lane.
Never self-approve in the same active context; use `code-reviewer` or `verifier` for the approval pass.
Before concluding: zero pending tasks, tests passing, verifier evidence collected.
Local WISE fork: edits to `src/**/*.ts` require `npm run build` before they show up in the running Claude Code plugin (it loads `dist/`, not `src/`). After editing TS, surface a one-line reminder per editing round — see `skills/local-build-reminder/SKILL.md`. `.mjs`/`.cjs`/`.md` files load from disk; no build needed.
</execution_protocols>

<commit_protocol>
Use git trailers to preserve decision context in every commit message.
Format: conventional commit subject line, optional body, then structured trailers.

Trailers (include when applicable — skip for trivial commits like typos or formatting):
- `Constraint:` active constraint that shaped this decision
- `Rejected:` alternative considered | reason for rejection
- `Directive:` warning or instruction for future modifiers of this code
- `Confidence:` high | medium | low
- `Scope-risk:` narrow | moderate | broad
- `Not-tested:` edge case or scenario not covered by tests

Example:
```
fix(auth): prevent silent session drops during long-running ops

Auth service returns inconsistent status codes on token expiry,
so the interceptor catches all 4xx and triggers inline refresh.

Constraint: Auth service does not support token introspection
Constraint: Must not add latency to non-expired-token paths
Rejected: Extend token TTL to 24h | security policy violation
Rejected: Background refresh on timer | race condition with concurrent requests
Confidence: high
Scope-risk: narrow
Directive: Error handling is intentionally broad (all 4xx) — do not narrow without verifying upstream behavior
Not-tested: Auth service cold-start latency >500ms
```
</commit_protocol>

<hooks_and_context>
Hooks inject `<system-reminder>` tags. Key patterns: `hook success: Success` (proceed), `[MAGIC KEYWORD: ...]` (invoke skill), `The boulder never stops` (ralph/ultrawork active).
Persistence: `<remember>` (7 days), `<remember priority>` (permanent).
Kill switches: `DISABLE_WISE`, `WISE_SKIP_HOOKS` (comma-separated).
</hooks_and_context>

<cancellation>
`/wise:cancel` ends execution modes. Cancel when done+verified or blocked. Don't cancel if work incomplete.
</cancellation>

<worktree_paths>
State: `.wise/state/`, `.wise/state/sessions/{sessionId}/`, `.wise/notepad.md`, `.wise/project-memory.json`, `.wise/plans/`, `.wise/research/`, `.wise/logs/`
Multi-repo: drop a `.wise-workspace` marker at a non-git parent dir to anchor `.wise/` there. Resolution: `WISE_STATE_DIR > .wise-workspace > git > cwd`. The session-start hook uses PID-aware liveness — a dead owner session no longer suppresses state restore. State paths use the canonical `resolveSessionStatePaths()` (branded `ReadPath`/`WritePath`) — see `docs/REFERENCE.md`.
</worktree_paths>

## Setup

Say "setup wise" or run `/wise:wise-setup`.
