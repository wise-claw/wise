/**
 * WISE Context Safety Hook (PreToolUse) - compatibility no-op
 *
 * TeamCreate was removed from this guard in #1006 because blocking lightweight
 * orchestration setup caused silent fallback behavior. ExitPlanMode was removed
 * in #1597 because blocking a lightweight plan-mode exit traps long-running
 * planning skills such as /deep-interview in irreversible approval loops once
 * context crosses the warning threshold.
 *
 * The script remains as a permissive compatibility shim so older patched hook
 * installations that still point at scripts/context-safety.mjs do not fail.
