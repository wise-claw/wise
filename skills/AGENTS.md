# skills

30 skill directories for workflow automation and specialized behaviors.

## Purpose

Skills are reusable workflow templates that can be invoked via `/wise:skill-name`. Each skill provides:
- Structured prompts for specific workflows
- Activation triggers (manual or automatic)
- Integration with execution modes

## Key Files

### Execution Mode Skills

### Domain Skills

| File | Skill | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| `project-session-manager/SKILL.md` | project-session-manager (+ `psm` alias) | Isolated dev environments |
| `writer-memory/SKILL.md` | writer-memory | Agentic memory for writers |
| `release/SKILL.md` | release | Generic release assistant — analyzes repo CI/rules, caches in `.wise/RELEASE_RULE.md`, guides the release |

## For AI Agents

### Working In This Directory

#### Skill Template Format

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: Brief description
triggers:
  - "keyword1"
  - "keyword2"
agent: executor  # Optional: which agent to use
model: sonnet    # Optional: model override
pipeline: [skill-name, follow-up-skill]  # Optional: standardized multi-skill flow
next-skill: follow-up-skill              # Optional: explicit handoff target
next-skill-args: --direct                # Optional: arguments for the next skill
handoff: .wise/plans/example.md           # Optional: artifact/context handed to next skill
---

# Skill Name

## Purpose
What this skill accomplishes.

## Workflow
1. Step one
2. Step two
3. Step three

## Usage
How to invoke this skill.

## Configuration
Any configurable options.
```

#### Skill Invocation

```bash
# Manual invocation
/wise:skill-name

# With arguments
/wise:skill-name arg1 arg2

# Auto-detected from keywords
"autopilot build me a REST API"  # Triggers autopilot skill
```

#### Creating a New Skill

1. Create `new-skill/SKILL.md` directory and file with YAML frontmatter
2. Define purpose, workflow, and usage
3. Add to skill registry (auto-detected from frontmatter)
4. Optionally add activation triggers
5. Create corresponding plugin-scoped skill/slash surface via `skills/new-skill/SKILL.md` (and generated artifacts when the build requires them)
6. Update `docs/参考.md` (Skills section, count)
7. If execution mode skill, also create `src/hooks/new-skill/` hook

### Common Patterns

**Skill chaining:**
```markdown
## Workflow
1. Invoke `explore` agent for context
2. Invoke `architect` for analysis
3. Invoke `executor` for implementation
4. Invoke `qa-tester` for verification
```

If `pipeline` / `next-skill` metadata is present, WISE appends a standardized **Skill Pipeline** handoff block to the rendered skill prompt so downstream steps are explicit.

**Conditional behavior:**
```markdown
## Workflow
1. Check if tests exist
   - If yes: Run tests first
   - If no: Create test plan
2. Proceed with implementation
```

### Testing Requirements

- Skills are verified via integration tests
- Test skill invocation with `/wise:skill-name`
- Verify trigger keywords activate correct skill
- For git-related skills, follow `templates/rules/git-workflow.md`

## Dependencies

### Internal
- Loaded by skill bridge (`scripts/build-skill-bridge.mjs`)
- References agents from `agents/`
- Uses hooks from `src/hooks/`

### External
None - pure markdown files.

## Skill Categories

| Category | Skills | Trigger Keywords |
|----------|--------|------------------|
| Execution | autopilot, ultrawork, ralph, team, ultraqa | "autopilot", "ulw", "ralph", "team" |
| Cleanup | ai-slop-cleaner | "deslop", "anti-slop", cleanup/refactor + slop smells |
| Planning | wise-plan, ralplan, deep-interview, ralph-init | "plan this", "interview me", "ouroboros" |
| Exploration | deepinit, sciwise, external-context | "deepinit", "research" |
| Utility | skillify, learner (deprecated alias), note, cancel, hud, setup, wise-doctor, wise-setup, wise-help, mcp-setup | "stop", "cancel" |
| Domain | psm, writer-memory, release | psm context |

## Auto-Activation

Some skills activate automatically based on context:

| Skill | Auto-Trigger Condition |
|-------|----------------------|
| autopilot | "autopilot", "build me", "I want a" |
| ultrawork | "ulw", "ultrawork" |
| ralph | "ralph", "don't stop until" |
| deep-interview | "deep interview", "interview me", "ouroboros", "don't assume" |
| cancel | "stop", "cancel", "abort" |

<!-- MANUAL:
- Team runtime wait semantics: `wise_run_team_wait.timeout_ms` only limits the wait call and does not stop workers.
- `timeoutSeconds` is removed from `wise_run_team_start`; use explicit `wise_run_team_cleanup` for intentional worker pane termination.
