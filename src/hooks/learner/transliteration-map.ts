/**
 * Korean transliteration map for cross-script trigger matching.
 *
 * Maps lowercase English trigger phrases to their Korean equivalents.
 * Used at cache-load time to expand triggersLower arrays so that
 * promptLower.includes(triggerLower) matches Korean user input.
 *
 * SCOPE: Only foreign-loanword transliterations, not native Korean translations.
 * Only skills with explicit `triggers:` in YAML frontmatter,
 * limited to phrases specific enough to avoid false positives.
 * Built-in skills (autopilot, ralph, etc.) are handled by keyword-detector
 * regex patterns, NOT by this map.
 *
 * To add a new locale: create a new map file (e.g., japanese-map.ts)
 * and compose expandTriggers calls in bridge.ts.
