## Installation

**Only the Claude Code Plugin method is supported.** Other installation methods (npm, bun, curl) are deprecated and may not work correctly.

### Claude Code Plugin (Required)

```bash
# Step 1: Add the marketplace
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/wise-claw/wise

# Step 2: Install the plugin
/plugin install wise
```

This integrates directly with Claude Code's plugin system and uses Node.js hooks.

> **Note**: Direct npm/bun global installs are **not supported** for the plugin install flow. When you only need the packaged CLI surface, the npm package exposes both `wise` and `wise`; use `wise` in examples unless troubleshooting needs the long alias.

### Requirements

- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude-code) installed
- One of:
  - **Claude Max/Pro subscription** (recommended for individuals)
  - **Anthropic API key** (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable)

---

## Configuration

### Project-Scoped Configuration (Recommended)

Configure wise for the current project only:

```
/wise:wise-setup --local
```

- Creates `./.claude/CLAUDE.md` in your current project
- Configuration applies only to this project
- Won't affect other projects or global settings
- **Safe**: Preserves your global CLAUDE.md

### Global Configuration

Configure wise for all Claude Code sessions:

```
/wise:wise-setup
```

- Creates `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` globally
- Configuration applies to all projects
- **Default**: explicitly overwrites existing `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`
- **Optional preserve mode**: keeps the base file, writes WISE to `~/.claude/CLAUDE-wise.md`, and lets `wise` force-load that companion config at launch while plain `claude` stays unchanged

### What Configuration Enables

| Feature           | Without     | With wise Config         |
| ----------------- | ----------- | ----------------------- |
| Agent delegation  | Manual only | Automatic based on task |
| Keyword detection | Disabled    | ultrawork, search       |
| Todo continuation | Basic       | Enforced completion     |
| Model routing     | Default     | Smart tier selection    |
| Skill composition | None        | Auto-combines skills    |

### Configuration Precedence

If both configurations exist, **project-scoped takes precedence** over global:

```
./.claude/CLAUDE.md  (project)   →  Overrides  →  ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md  (global)
```

### Environment Variables

| Variable                   | Default              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

#### Centralized State with `WISE_STATE_DIR`

By default, WISE stores state in `{worktree}/.wise/`. This is lost when worktrees are deleted. To preserve state across worktree lifecycles, set `WISE_STATE_DIR`:

```bash
# In your shell profile (~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, etc.)
export WISE_STATE_DIR="$HOME/.claude/wise"
```

This resolves to `~/.claude/wise/{project-identifier}/` where the project identifier uses a hash of the git remote URL (stable across worktrees/clones) with a fallback to the directory path hash for local-only repos.

If both a legacy `{worktree}/.wise/` directory and a centralized directory exist, WISE logs a notice and uses the centralized directory. You can then migrate data from the legacy directory and remove it.

#### Multi-repo workspaces with `.wise-workspace`

When you have several independent git repos under one parent directory and the parent itself is **not** a git repo, WISE cannot infer a shared root via `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`. Each sub-repo would get its own isolated `.wise/`. To anchor a single `.wise/` at the parent, drop a `.wise-workspace` marker file there:

```bash
cd /path/to/my-workspace            # parent dir (not a git repo)
echo '{}' > .wise-workspace          # empty JSON is fine
```

From any sub-directory (including inside any sub-git-repo), WISE resolves `.wise/` to `/path/to/my-workspace/.wise/`. The marker may also carry an explicit project identifier so all sessions share state regardless of the parent dir name:

```json
{ "id": "my-org-bidchex" }
```

Resolution order inside `getWiseRoot()`:

1. `WISE_STATE_DIR` (centralized).
2. `.wise-workspace` marker (multi-repo workspace).
3. `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` (monorepo / single repo).
4. `process.cwd()` (last resort).

Once a workspace is anchored, multiple Claude Code sessions in different sub-repos can run `/ultragoal`, `/ralph`, `/ultrawork`, `/autopilot` in parallel without bleeding state. For `/ultragoal` specifically, pass `--plan-id <id>` or `--auto-plan-id` on `create-goals` so each session writes to `.wise/ultragoal/plans/{planId}/` instead of the shared `goals.json` — see "ultragoal multi-plan" below. The PARALLEL SESSION WARNING in `session-start.mjs` performs a PID-aware liveness check and no longer suppresses restore when the owner session is dead.

#### `.wise/handoffs/` shared contract

`.wise/handoffs/` is intentionally **shared across team runs** by design. Its purpose is inter-session message passing: team stage handoffs (plan → prd → exec → verify) accumulate here so a later `team` run can resume from the last non-terminal stage without losing decision history.

**Only the `team` skill writes to `.wise/handoffs/`.** All other code that reads the directory does so read-only. This is enforced by the lint test `tests/lint/handoffs-writers.test.ts`, which scans `src/**` and `templates/**` and fails if any file outside `src/team/` or `src/hooks/team-pipeline/` references `handoffs/` as a write target.

- Handoff files survive `TeamDelete` and session cancellation intentionally — they are post-mortem artifacts.
- Do **not** session-scope `.wise/handoffs/` unless the `team` skill explicitly evolves to per-session inboxes (tracked as a follow-up in the ADR).

#### Branded path types (`ReadPath` / `WritePath`)

State-file path resolution returns a branded struct from `resolveSessionStatePaths()` in `src/lib/worktree-paths.ts`:

```ts
interface SessionStatePaths {
  sessionScoped: string;
  legacy: string;
  effectiveRead: ReadPath;   // string & { __brand: 'ReadPath' }
  effectiveWrite: WritePath; // string & { __brand: 'WritePath' }
}
```

The brand prevents a hook from silently passing a read-fallback path to a writer (or vice versa) — TypeScript rejects the cross-assignment at compile time. The only legitimate producer of the brand is `resolveSessionStatePaths()` itself; an ESLint `no-restricted-syntax` rule in `eslint.config.js` blocks `as ReadPath` / `as WritePath` casts anywhere outside `worktree-paths.ts` and its tests. Compile-time regression guard at `src/lib/__tests__/session-state-paths.type-test.ts`.

#### Legacy state migration (`WISE_MIGRATE_LEGACY_STATE`)

When you adopt `WISE_STATE_DIR` or `.wise-workspace` on a repo that already has existing `{worktree}/.wise/state/` files, you can opt in to a one-shot copy of legacy state into the new session-scoped path:

```bash
export WISE_MIGRATE_LEGACY_STATE=1
```

Semantics:
- **Trigger**: checked once per state-file read by callers that wrap their write through the migration helper.
- **Operation**: copies `{wiseRoot}/state/{name}-state.json` → `{wiseRoot}/state/sessions/{sessionId}/{name}-state.json` using an atomic `.migrating` sentinel + rename for crash recovery.
- **Idempotent**: a second run with the flag set is a no-op if the session-scoped file already exists.
- **Opt-in only**: never triggers automatically; only when `WISE_MIGRATE_LEGACY_STATE=1` is set.
- **No auto-trigger**: do not set this permanently in your shell profile; set it once for the migration session, then unset it.

#### Rollback / disable multi-repo (`WISE_DISABLE_MULTIREPO`)

If the workspace-marker resolution causes unexpected behaviour (e.g., after dropping a stale `.wise-workspace` marker), you can disable multi-repo path resolution in one env-var flip:

```bash
export WISE_DISABLE_MULTIREPO=1
```

Exact semantics:
- **Skips** `.wise-workspace` marker detection — `findWorkspaceRoot()` returns `null` immediately.
- **Falls back** to the standard `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` → `process.cwd()` resolution order.
- **Preserves** `WISE_STATE_DIR` if set — centralized state storage still works.
- **Scope**: per-process; set in the shell session where you run `claude`, not project-wide.

To restore multi-repo behaviour, unset the variable:

```bash
unset WISE_DISABLE_MULTIREPO
```

#### Ultragoal multi-plan layout

Default layout (single plan, monorepo / single session):

```
.wise/ultragoal/brief.md
.wise/ultragoal/goals.json
.wise/ultragoal/ledger.jsonl
```

Multi-plan layout, enabled by `--plan-id <id>` or `--auto-plan-id` on `wise ultragoal create-goals`:

```
.wise/ultragoal/plans/{planId}/brief.md
.wise/ultragoal/plans/{planId}/goals.json
.wise/ultragoal/plans/{planId}/ledger.jsonl
```

`--auto-plan-id` derives `{epochMs}-{slug}` from the brief title, so two parallel sessions running `wise ultragoal create-goals --auto-plan-id ...` never collide. Subsequent commands (`status`, `add-goal`, `complete-goals`, `checkpoint`, `record-review-blockers`) auto-resolve the plan when there is exactly one; when there are multiple, they require `--plan-id <id>`. `wise ultragoal list-plans` enumerates the available plan ids.

### When to Re-run Setup

- **First time**: Run after installation (choose project or global)
- **After updates**: Re-run to get the latest configuration
- **Different machines**: Run on each machine where you use Claude Code
- **New projects**: Run `/wise:wise-setup --local` in each project that needs wise

> **NOTE**: After updating the plugin (via `npm update`, `git pull`, or Claude Code's plugin update), you MUST re-run `/wise:wise-setup` to apply the latest CLAUDE.md changes.

### Remote WISE / Remote MCP Access

Issue #1653 asked whether WISE can "connect to a remote WISE" so one development machine can browse files on lab/test machines without opening an interactive SSH session.

The narrow, coherent answer today is:

- **Supported**: connect to a **remote MCP server** through the unified MCP registry
- **Not implemented**: a general "WISE cluster", shared remote filesystem view, or automatic remote-WISE federation
- **Still appropriate for full remote shell workflows**: SSH, worktrees, or a mounted/network filesystem

If a remote host already exposes an MCP endpoint, add it to your MCP registry (or Claude settings and then re-run setup so WISE syncs the registry to Codex too):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "remoteWise": {
      "url": "https://lab.example.com/mcp",
      "timeout": 30
    }
  }
}
```

This gives WISE a coherent remote connection surface for MCP-backed tools. It does **not** make all remote files magically appear as a local workspace, and it does **not** replace SSH for arbitrary shell access.

If you need richer cross-machine behavior in the future, that would require a separate authenticated remote execution/filesystem design rather than stretching the current local-workspace architecture.

### Company Context via MCP

WISE also supports a narrow company-context contract on top of the existing MCP surface.

Configure it in the standard WISE config files:

- Project: `.claude/wise.jsonc`
- User: `~/.config/claude-wise/config.jsonc`

```jsonc
{
  "companyContext": {
    "tool": "mcp__vendor__get_company_context",
    "onError": "warn",
  },
}
```

- `tool` is the full MCP tool name to call.
- `onError` controls prompt-level fallback: `warn`, `silent`, or `fail`.
- The MCP server itself is still registered through the normal Claude/WISE MCP setup path.

This remains a prompt-level workflow contract, not runtime enforcement. For the full interface, trigger stages, and trust boundary, see [company-context-interface.md](./company-context-interface.md).

### Agent Customization

Edit agent files in `~/.claude/agents/` to customize behavior:

```yaml
---
name: architect
description: Your custom description
tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash, Edit
model: opus # or sonnet, haiku
# Optional: effort inherits from the parent Claude Code session unless you add an explicit override.
# effort: high
---
Your custom system prompt here...
```

Bundled WISE agent prompts currently do **not** ship an `effort:` frontmatter field. Any effort language inside `agents/*.md` is behavioral guidance for the prompt body, while runtime effort inherits from the parent Claude Code session unless the agent markdown explicitly declares an override.

### Project-Level Config

Create `.claude/CLAUDE.md` in your project for project-specific instructions:

```markdown
# Project Context

This is a TypeScript monorepo using:

- Bun runtime
- React for frontend
- PostgreSQL database

## Conventions

- Use functional components
- All API routes in /src/api
- Tests alongside source files
```

### Stop Callback Notification Tags

Configure tags for Telegram/Discord stop callbacks with `wise config-stop-callback`.

```bash
# Set/replace tags
wise config-stop-callback telegram --enable --token <bot_token> --chat <chat_id> --tag-list "@alice,bob"
wise config-stop-callback discord --enable --webhook <url> --tag-list "@here,123456789012345678,role:987654321098765432"

# Incremental updates
wise config-stop-callback telegram --add-tag charlie
wise config-stop-callback discord --remove-tag @here
wise config-stop-callback discord --clear-tags

# Inspect current callback config
wise config-stop-callback telegram --show
wise config-stop-callback discord --show
```

Tag behavior:

- Telegram: `alice` is normalized to `@alice`
- Discord: supports `@here`, `@everyone`, numeric user IDs (`<@id>`), and role tags (`role:<id>` -> `<@&id>`)
- `file` callbacks ignore tag options

## Runtime storage and goal artifacts

WISE documentation should describe goal and workflow artifacts by their logical role first, then map that role to the runtime-specific storage root. Do not treat `.omx/` as a universal path: it is the legacy OMX runtime root, while WISE uses `.wise/` for local project state.

### Runtime root mapping

| Runtime                      | Project-local root     | User/global root            | Notes                                                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| WISE                          | `.wise/`                | `~/.wise/`                   | Canonical WISE storage for project-local state, plans, notepads, logs, research, and ask artifacts.                                                      |
| OMX compatibility/runtime-v1 | `.omx/`                | `~/.omx/`                   | Compatibility root for older OMX sessions and cross-runtime handoffs. Mention only when documenting OMX-specific behavior.                              |
| OMO native                   | runtime-owned OMO path | runtime-owned OMO user path | OMO-native storage is owned by that runtime. WISE docs should name the logical artifact role unless an OMO command explicitly documents a concrete path. |

### Logical goal artifact roles

Use these names when writing docs or handoffs so the same concept remains portable across WISE, OMX compatibility, and OMO-native runtimes:

When an environment variable such as `WISE_STATE_DIR` centralizes storage, resolve the WISE project-local root through that setting before expanding the paths above. In docs, phrase this as "the WISE state root" or "the team coordination root" when the exact filesystem path may vary.

### `/goal` interoperability notes

Claude Code's `/goal` feature owns its hidden goal state. WISE integrations should not mutate hidden Claude Code goal storage directly. When WISE needs a goal-related artifact, create or update an explicit WISE artifact such as `.wise/specs/<slug>.md`, `.wise/plans/<slug>.md`, or `.wise/state/<mode>.json` and record any `/goal` relationship as metadata or prose in that artifact.

For cross-runtime handoffs:

- Prefer logical names such as "approved execution plan" or "team coordination root" over hardcoded `.omx/...` paths.
- Use `.wise/...` examples for WISE-facing docs and commands.
- Use `.omx/...` examples only for OMX compatibility behavior.
- For OMO-native behavior, link to or quote the OMO command's documented path instead of inventing an WISE/OMX path.

## Plugin directory flags

When you launch WISE via a local development checkout instead of the marketplace plugin, you can configure how WISE discovers agents, skills, and commands.

> **Recommended for local development**: Use `wise --plugin-dir <path>` (paired with `wise setup --plugin-dir-mode`). Unlike `claude plugin marketplace add`, this flow loads agents/skills directly from your checkout with **no plugin cache**, so edits are picked up on the next session without `marketplace update` / `plugin update` round-trips — much faster iteration.

### `wise --plugin-dir <path>`

**Usage**: Non-consuming launcher flag that captures your local checkout path.

```bash
wise --plugin-dir /path/to/wise setup --plugin-dir-mode
```

- **What it does**: Parses `--plugin-dir <path>` (or `--plugin-dir=<path>`), resolves it to an absolute path, sets `WISE_PLUGIN_ROOT` environment variable, then passes the flag through to Claude Code untouched.
- **Non-consuming**: The flag stays in the argument list so Claude Code's plugin loader still sees it.
- **Precedence**: Explicit `--plugin-dir` flag wins over any pre-existing `WISE_PLUGIN_ROOT` env var (with a warning if they disagree).
- **Resolution**: Relative paths are resolved to absolute via `path.resolve()`. Note: `~` is **not** expanded — use `$HOME` or an absolute path instead.
- **Pair with setup**: `--plugin-dir` alone only affects the current Claude session. You must **also** run `wise setup --plugin-dir-mode` (or let auto-detection kick in from `WISE_PLUGIN_ROOT`) so HUD, hooks, and CLAUDE.md are installed for the linked checkout. Skipping this step leaves `~/.claude/` pointing at a stale plugin root.

### `claude --plugin-dir <path>` (direct)

**Usage**: When you launch Claude Code directly without the `wise` shim.

```bash
export WISE_PLUGIN_ROOT=/path/to/wise
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/wise
```

- **Requirement**: You must manually set `WISE_PLUGIN_ROOT` environment variable so the HUD wrapper and other env-aware components can resolve the same path as the plugin loader.
- **Why**: The HUD bundle needs to know where agents/skills/commands are located so they stay in sync with the plugin instance.
- **Note**: Plain `claude` (without `wise`) does not automatically capture `--plugin-dir` for you.

### `wise setup --plugin-dir-mode`

**Usage**: Explicit flag to enable dev plugin-dir mode during setup.

```bash
wise setup --plugin-dir-mode
```

- **What it does**: Skips copying agents and bundled skills into `~/.claude/` because the plugin already provides them at runtime via `--plugin-dir`.
- **Still installs**:
  - HUD bundle (`~/.claude/hud/`)
  - Git hooks (`.git/hooks/`, if applicable)
  - CLAUDE.md configuration files
  - `.wise-config.json` state
- **Conflicts with `--no-plugin`**: If both flags are set, `--no-plugin` takes precedence (with a warning).
- **Auto-detection**: If `WISE_PLUGIN_ROOT` is already set in the environment, `--plugin-dir-mode` is auto-enabled (unless `--no-plugin` overrides it).

### `wise doctor --plugin-dir <path>` (NEW)

**Usage**: Run diagnostics with a specific plugin directory.

```bash
wise doctor --plugin-dir /path/to/wise
wise doctor conflicts --plugin-dir /path/to/wise
```

- **What it does**: Resolves the provided path to absolute, sets `WISE_PLUGIN_ROOT` before the doctor action runs, matching `launch.ts` semantics.
- **Precedence**: Explicit `--plugin-dir` flag wins over pre-existing `WISE_PLUGIN_ROOT` env var (with a warning if they disagree).
- **Subcommand support**: Works with both `wise doctor` and `wise doctor conflicts`.
- **Output**: Diagnostic results reflect the plugin directory you specified.

### `WISE_PLUGIN_ROOT` environment variable

**Usage**: Authoritative source for the active plugin root when launching Claude Code.

```bash
export WISE_PLUGIN_ROOT=/path/to/wise
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/wise
```

- **Set by**: `wise --plugin-dir <path>` launcher (via `src/cli/launch.ts`).
- **Read by**: HUD wrapper, setup auto-detect, doctor diagnostics.
- **Required when**: Using `claude --plugin-dir` directly (without the `wise` shim), so downstream components can resolve the same path.
- **Precedence**: Explicit CLI flags override this env var (with warnings).

### Decision matrix: which flag/mode to use?

| Your setup                            | Launch command                                               | Setup command                   | Expected behavior                                                   |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Marketplace plugin** (recommended)  | `wise` or `claude` (default)                                  | `wise setup`                     | Normal: agents/skills copied to `~/.claude/`                        |
| **Local dev checkout, want WISE shim** | `wise --plugin-dir /path`                                     | `wise setup --plugin-dir-mode`   | Dev mode: agents/skills loaded from `/path`, not copied             |
| **Local dev checkout, no WISE shim**   | `claude --plugin-dir /path` + `export WISE_PLUGIN_ROOT=/path` | `wise setup --plugin-dir-mode`   | Dev mode + manual env: agents/skills loaded from `/path`            |
| **Local dev, want bundled skills**    | `wise --plugin-dir /path`                                     | `wise setup --no-plugin`         | Forces local bundled skills to `~/.claude/skills/`, ignoring plugin |
| **Troubleshooting a specific path**   | N/A                                                          | `wise doctor --plugin-dir /path` | Diagnostics show status for `/path`                                 |

## CLI Commands: ask/team/session

### `wise ask`

```bash
wise ask claude "review this patch"
wise ask codex "review this patch from a security perspective"
wise ask gemini --prompt "suggest UX improvements"
wise ask cursor --prompt "apply this implementation plan"
wise ask claude --agent-prompt executor --prompt "create an implementation plan"
```

- Provider matrix: `claude | codex | gemini | grok | cursor`
- Artifacts: `.wise/artifacts/ask/{provider}-{slug}-{timestamp}.md`
- Canonical env vars: `WISE_ASK_ADVISOR_SCRIPT`, `WISE_ASK_ORIGINAL_TASK`
- Phase-1 aliases (deprecated warning): `OMX_ASK_ADVISOR_SCRIPT`, `OMX_ASK_ORIGINAL_TASK`
- Skill entrypoint: `/wise:ask <claude|codex|gemini|grok|cursor> <prompt>` routes to this command

### `wise team` (CLI runtime surface)

```bash
wise team 2:codex "review auth flow"
wise team status review-auth-flow
wise team shutdown review-auth-flow --force
wise team api claim-task --input '{"team_name":"auth-review","task_id":"1","worker":"worker-1"}' --json
```

Supported entrypoints: direct start (`wise team [N:agent] "<task>"`), `status`, `shutdown`, and `api`.

Native team worker worktrees are an opt-in/config-gated runtime-v2 rollout. See [Native Team Worktree Mode](TEAM-WORKTREE-MODE.md) for the worktree path contract, canonical `WISE_TEAM_STATE_ROOT` behavior, status fields, and dirty-worktree cleanup policy.

Topology behavior:

- inside classic tmux (`$TMUX` set): reuse the current tmux surface for split-pane or `--new-window` layouts
- inside cmux (`CMUX_SURFACE_ID` without `$TMUX`): create native cmux splits for visible team workers
- plain terminal: launch a detached tmux session for team workers

### `wise session search`

```bash
wise session search "team leader stale"
wise session search notify-hook --since 7d
wise session search provider-routing --project all --json
```

- Defaults to the current project/worktree scope
- Use `--project all` to search across all local Claude project transcripts
- Supports `--limit`, `--session`, `--since`, `--context`, `--case-sensitive`, and `--json`
- MCP/tool surface: `session_search` returns structured JSON for agents and automations

## Legacy MCP Team Runtime Tools (Deprecated, Opt-In Only)

The Team MCP runtime server is **not enabled by default**. If manually enabled, runtime tools are still **CLI-only deprecated** and return a deterministic error envelope:

```json
{
  "code": "deprecated_cli_only",
  "message": "Legacy team MCP runtime tools are deprecated. Use the wise team CLI instead."
}
```

Use `wise team ...` replacements instead:

| Tool                   | Purpose                                                    |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `wise_run_team_start`   | **Deprecated** → `wise team [N:agent-type] "<task>"`        |
| `wise_run_team_status`  | **Deprecated** → `wise team status <team-name>`             |
| `wise_run_team_wait`    | **Deprecated** → monitor via `wise team status <team-name>` |
| `wise_run_team_cleanup` | **Deprecated** → `wise team shutdown <team-name> [--force]` |

Optional compatibility enablement (manual only):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "team": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bridge/team-mcp.cjs"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Runtime status semantics

- **Artifact-first terminal convergence**: team monitors prefer finalized state artifacts when present.
- **Deterministic parse-failure handling**: malformed result artifacts are treated as terminal `failed`.
- **Cleanup scope**: shutdown/cleanup only clears `.wise/state/team/{teamName}` for the target team (never sibling teams).

### Artifact descriptors and bounded handoff

WISE handoffs follow an artifact-first discipline:

- **Control plane** data stays small and operational: queue state, worker claims, session state, and interop task/message envelopes.
- **Data plane** artifacts stay durable: plans, prompts, specs, traces, and result files.
- Large payloads should be referenced by descriptor instead of copied into control-plane state.
- Current low-risk call sites follow this split explicitly:
  - shared interop state writes oversized task descriptions, task results, and shared messages to `.wise/state/interop/artifacts/**`
  - prompt persistence keeps durable prompt/response files in `.wise/prompts/**` and exposes descriptor metadata through job status records

Canonical descriptor fields:

| Field          | Meaning                                                      |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `kind`         | Artifact type such as `plan`, `prompt`, `result`, or `trace` |
| `path`         | Durable artifact path                                        |
| `contentHash?` | Optional integrity hint                                      |
| `createdAt`    | Artifact creation timestamp                                  |
| `producer`     | Owning worker/tool/skill                                     |
| `sizeBytes?`   | Optional size for threshold checks                           |
| `retention`    | Retention/ownership hint                                     |
| `expiresAt?`   | Optional expiry for short-lived artifacts                    |

Bounded handoff policy:

1. Keep small payloads inline only when the call site's explicit threshold allows it.
2. For larger payloads, pass a short summary plus the descriptor.
3. Keep durable content in artifact paths such as `.wise/plans/`, `.wise/prompts/`, and related artifact stores rather than embedding full bodies into queue or status records.

## Goal Workflow UX: `/goal`, Ralph, Team, UltraQA, Ultragoal

WISE exposes several ways to pursue a goal-shaped task. They are complementary, not interchangeable. Choose one primary loop authority per session and use the others as evidence producers or handoff targets.

| Surface                 | Runtime owner                                     | User-facing promise                                           | Completion evidence                                                          | Notes                                                                                                                                                           |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Claude Code `/goal`     | Claude Code native session loop                   | Keep working toward one stated completion condition           | Evidence surfaced in the conversation for the `/goal` evaluator              | Cite Claude Code/Anthropic docs or changelog only for `/goal` behavior. The evaluator must not be described as independently running commands or reading files. |
| Ralph                   | WISE skill + Stop-hook enforcement                 | Persistent single-owner implementation until PRD stories pass | Tests/build/lint/typecheck plus reviewer verification                        | Prefer when correctness depends on WISE's PRD, progress, and reviewer gates.                                                                                     |
| Team                    | WISE native/team or CLI team runtime               | Coordinated multi-agent execution over assigned tasks         | Worker task results, commits, staged `team-verify`/`team-fix` evidence       | Prefer when ownership boundaries and parallel lanes matter.                                                                                                     |
| UltraQA                 | WISE QA cycling skill                              | Repeat diagnose/fix cycles until a quality gate passes        | Command output from the requested QA goal each cycle                         | Prefer after the implementation target is known but verification still fails.                                                                                   |
| Artifact-only Ultragoal | Durable goal ledger/checkpoints/handoff artifacts | Track goal state without starting another active loop         | Goal artifact, checkpoints, handoff prompt, attached command/review evidence | Prefer when `/goal` is unavailable, unsafe, or conflicts with an active WISE loop.                                                                               |

### `/goal` source and evidence boundary

Use Claude Code/Anthropic sources for `/goal` facts, including:

- Claude Code `/goal` documentation: <https://code.claude.com/docs/en/goal>
- Anthropic Claude Code changelog: <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anthropics/claude-code/main/CHANGELOG.md>

Do not cite OpenAI/Codex documentation as authority for Claude Code `/goal`. In WISE docs, examples, and handoff prompts, keep this limitation explicit: the `/goal` evaluator judges visible conversation evidence. It should not be described as independently executing shell commands, reading files, inspecting hidden state, or replacing WISE's final review gates.

### Recommended conflict handling

When multiple loops could apply, use this deterministic policy:

1. **refuse**: if Ralph, Team, UltraQA, autopilot, or another Stop-hook loop is already active and a new `/goal` would compete for continuation authority.
2. **adopt_existing**: if Claude Code `/goal` is already active and the WISE workflow can attach evidence to that same condition without changing loop ownership.
3. **artifact_only**: if `/goal` is unavailable because of hooks/trust/settings, or if the user only needs durable planning, checkpointing, and evidence capture.

`/goal` evaluator success can be useful evidence, but WISE completion should still require the relevant durable proof: command output, changed files, reviewer verdicts, task results, or release artifacts.

For the shorter user-facing chooser, see [Mode Selection Guide](./shared/mode-selection-guide.md#goal-oriented-workflow-selection).

## Skills (38 Total)

Includes bundled workflow, utility, domain, and compatibility skills. Runtime truth comes from the builtin skill loader scanning `skills/*/SKILL.md` and expanding aliases declared in frontmatter.

Marketplace/plugin installs compact the native plugin `skills/*/SKILL.md` files during `wise setup`: Claude Code receives concise registry descriptions for every bundled skill, while the full on-demand instructions are preserved under `skill-bodies/*/SKILL.md` and loaded by WISE when a skill is invoked. Source checkouts and standalone installs keep the full `skills/*/SKILL.md` bodies in place.

## Slash Commands

Most installed skills are exposed as `/wise:<skill-name>`. Deep Interview is intentionally documented with the short `/deep-interview` path because that path receives WISE's rendered runtime threshold guidance before the interview starts. The skills table above is the full runtime-backed list; the commands below highlight common entrypoints and aliases. Compatibility keyword modes like `deep-analyze` and `tdd` are prompt-triggered behaviors, not standalone slash commands. WISE's manual compaction helper is plugin-scoped as `/wise:compact`; bare `/compact` remains Claude Code's native command and is not shadowed by WISE. The helper preserves the user's note and instructs them to run bare `/compact`; WISE does not invoke native compaction itself because Claude Code's built-in `/compact` is not a prompt skill.

### Skill Pipeline Metadata (Preview)

Built-in skills and slash-loaded skills can now declare a lightweight pipeline/handoff contract in frontmatter:

```yaml
pipeline: [deep-interview, plan, autopilot]
next-skill: plan
next-skill-args: --consensus --direct
handoff: .wise/specs/deep-interview-{slug}.md
```

When present, WISE appends a standardized **Skill Pipeline** section to the rendered skill prompt so the current stage, handoff artifact, and explicit next `Skill("wise:...")` invocation are carried forward consistently.

### Skills 2.0 Compatibility (MVP)

WISE's canonical project-local skill directory remains `.wise/skills/`, and the runtime also reads Claude Code project skills from `.claude/skills/` plus compatibility skills from `.agents/skills/`.

For builtin and slash-loaded skills, WISE also appends a standardized **Skill Resources** section when the skill directory contains bundled assets such as helper scripts, templates, or support libraries. This helps agents reuse packaged skill resources instead of recreating them ad hoc.

## Claude Code `/goal` Adapter Design

WISE treats Claude Code `/goal` as a native execution loop that can be handed off to, not as the durable source of truth for WISE completion. The design contract is documented in [docs/design/CLAUDE_CODE_GOAL_ADAPTER.md](./design/CLAUDE_CODE_GOAL_ADAPTER.md).

Key contract points:

- Claude Code `/goal` facts must cite Claude Code or Anthropic sources only. OpenAI/Codex references are comparison sources, not authority for Claude Code behavior.
- The adapter renders a measurable `/goal <condition>` handoff; it must not mutate hidden Claude Code session state directly.
- The deterministic conflict policy is exactly one of `refuse`, `adopt_existing`, or `artifact_only`; competing Ralph/autopilot/Stop-hook/Team/UltraQA loops must not continue with only a warning.
- `/goal` evaluator success is evidence for WISE final review, not completion by itself; WISE still requires surfaced command/test/docs evidence.
- WISE stores durable goal ledgers and evidence under WISE-owned logical artifacts and `.wise/`-resolved paths, not hardcoded `.omx/` paths.

## Hooks System

WISE registers 20 hook scripts across 11 Claude Code lifecycle events. For detailed documentation, see [HOOKS.md](./HOOKS.md).

### Hooks by Lifecycle Event

| Event                  | Scripts                                                                                                           | Timeout          |

| **PermissionRequest**  | `permission-handler.mjs` (Bash only)                                                                              | 5s               |
| **PostToolUse**        | `post-tool-verifier.mjs`, `project-memory-posttool.mjs`                                                           | 3s, 3s           |
| **PostToolUseFailure** | `post-tool-use-failure.mjs`                                                                                       | 3s               |
| **SubagentStart**      | `subagent-tracker.mjs start`                                                                                      | 3s               |
| **SubagentStop**       | `subagent-tracker.mjs stop`, `verify-deliverables.mjs`                                                            | 5s, 5s           |
| **PreCompact**         | `pre-compact.mjs`, `project-memory-precompact.mjs`                                                                | 10s, 5s          |
| **Stop**               | `context-guard-stop.mjs`, `persistent-mode.cjs`, `code-simplifier.mjs`                                            | 5s, 10s, 5s      |
| **SessionEnd**         | `session-end.mjs`                                                                                                 | 30s              |

> **Note**: autopilot, ralph, ultrawork, and ultraqa are **skills** (activated via keyword-detector), not hooks. The `persistent-mode.cjs` hook enforces their continuation by blocking the Stop event.

### Code Simplifier Hook

The `code-simplifier` Stop hook automatically delegates recently modified source files to the
`code-simplifier` agent after each Claude turn. It is **disabled by default** and must be
explicitly enabled via the global WISE config file:

- Linux/Unix default: `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}/wise/config.json`
- macOS/Windows legacy/default path: `~/.wise/config.json`
- Existing legacy `~/.wise/config.json` continues to be read as a fallback where applicable.

**Enable:**

```json
{
  "codeSimplifier": {
    "enabled": true
  }
}
```

**Full config options:**

```json
{
  "codeSimplifier": {
    "enabled": true,
    "extensions": [".ts", ".tsx", ".js", ".jsx", ".py", ".go", ".rs"],
    "maxFiles": 10
  }
}
```

| Option       | Type       | Default                                         | Description                        |
| ------------ | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `enabled`    | `boolean`  | `false`                                         | Opt-in to automatic simplification |
| `extensions` | `string[]` | `[".ts",".tsx",".js",".jsx",".py",".go",".rs"]` | File extensions to consider        |
| `maxFiles`   | `number`   | `10`                                            | Maximum files simplified per turn  |

**How it works:**

1. When Claude stops, the hook runs `git diff HEAD --name-only` to find modified files
2. If modified source files are found, the hook injects a message asking Claude to delegate to the `code-simplifier` agent
3. The agent simplifies the files for clarity and consistency without changing behavior
4. A turn-scoped marker prevents the hook from triggering more than once per turn cycle

### Localized triggers (Korean / Japanese)

The keyword detector recognizes localized aliases in addition to the English trigger phrases above. Each alias maps to the same skill/mode as its English counterpart:

| Keyword          | Korean      | Japanese           |
| ---------------- | ----------- | ------------------ |
| `ralph`          | 랄프        | ラルフ             |
| `autopilot`      | 오토파일럿  | オートパイロット   |
| `ultrawork`      | 울트라워크  | ウルトラワーク     |
| `ralplan`        | 랄플랜      | ラルプラン         |
| `ultrathink`     | 울트라씽크  | ウルトラシンク     |
| `ccg`            | 씨씨지      | シーシージー       |
| `deep-interview` | 딥인터뷰    | ディープインタビュー |
| `tdd`            | 테스트 퍼스트 | テスト ファースト |
| `code-review`    | 코드 리뷰   | コード レビュー    |
| `security-review`| 보안 리뷰   | セキュリティ レビュー |
| `deepsearch`     | 딥 서치     | ディープ サーチ    |
| `analyze`        | 딥 분석     | ディープ アナライズ |

`cancelwise` / `stopwise` have no localized alias (cancellation is matched only by the English tokens).

#### Localized routing behavior

- **Substring matching (aggressive routing).** Korean and Japanese have no ASCII word boundary, so localized aliases are matched as substrings rather than whole words. This is intentional: a localized alias embedded in a longer noun phrase still routes — e.g. `コードレビュー記事を要約して` ("summarize this code-review article") activates **code-review** mode. Prefer the English form, or phrase around the alias, if you do not want that behavior.
- **Reviewer-suffix guard.** `code-review` / `security-review` use a negative lookahead so "reviewer"-style nouns do not trigger review mode: `(?!어)` blocks Korean 리뷰어, and `(?!ア)` blocks any Japanese レビューア… form (e.g. レビューアー).
- **Informational suppression.** Help-style questions are suppressed and pass through without activating a mode — e.g. Korean `뭐야` / Japanese `とは` / `使い方` near an alias.
- **Difference questions.** Japanese "difference" phrasing — `…の違いを教えて`/`違いを説明`/`違いを知りたい` and `どう違う`/`何が違う`/`どこが違う` (e.g. `ディープサーチと普通の検索の違いを教えて`) — is treated as informational and suppressed. A work verb after `違い` (e.g. `違いを修正して`) is **not** suppressed and still activates.

### Examples

```bash
# In Claude Code:

# Maximum parallelism

```json
{
  "wiseHud": {
    "preset": "focused",
    "elements": {
      "cwd": true,
      "gitRepo": true,
      "gitBranch": true,

Additional `wiseHud` layout and label options (top-level):

| Option     | Description                                                                       | Default    |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| `maxWidth` | Maximum HUD line width (terminal columns)                                         | unset      |
| `wrapMode` | `truncate` (ellipsis) or `wrap` (break at `\|` boundaries) when `maxWidth` is set | `truncate` |
| `locale`   | HUD label preset. Supported values: `en`, `zh-CN`                                 | `en`       |
| `labels`   | Per-label HUD text overrides; supported keys only                                 | unset      |

`locale` and `labels` affect only HUD labels. English remains the default, unsupported locale values and unknown label keys are ignored, and explicit `labels` override the locale preset. Supported label keys are `context`, `tokens`, `tool`, `agent`, `skill`, `ralph`, `background`, `thinking`, `staged`, `modified`, `untracked`, `ahead`, and `behind`.

Example:

```json
{
  "wiseHud": {
    "locale": "zh-CN",
    "labels": {
      "context": "CTX"
    }
  }
}
```

Available presets: `minimal`, `focused`, `full`, `dense`, `analytics`, `opencode`

| Commands not found    | Re-run `/wise:wise-setup`                                             |
| Hooks not executing   | Check hook permissions: `chmod +x ~/.claude/hooks/**/*.sh`                       |
| Agents not delegating | Verify CLAUDE.md is loaded: check `./.claude/CLAUDE.md` or `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` |
| LSP tools not working | Install language servers: `npm install -g typescript-language-server`            |
| Token limit errors    | Use `/wise:` for token-efficient execution                           |

### Auto-Update

Wise includes a silent auto-update system that checks for updates in the background.

Features:

- **Rate-limited**: Checks at most once every 24 hours
- **Concurrent-safe**: Lock file prevents simultaneous update attempts
- **Cross-platform**: Works on both macOS and Linux

To manually update, re-run the plugin install command or use Claude Code's built-in update mechanism.

### Uninstall

Use Claude Code's plugin management:

```
/plugin uninstall wise@wise
```

Or manually remove the installed files:

```bash
rm ~/.claude/agents/{architect,document-specialist,explore,designer,writer,vision,critic,analyst,executor,qa-tester}.md
rm ~/.claude/commands/{analyze,autopilot,deepsearch,plan,review,ultrawork}.md
```
