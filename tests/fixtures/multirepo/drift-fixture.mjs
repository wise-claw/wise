// Drift fixture for scripts/ci/check-multirepo-paths.mjs
//
// This file intentionally contains a raw .wise construction that bypasses
// resolveSessionStatePaths()/getWiseRoot(). The gate must DETECT this when
// the file is scanned outside its whitelisted parent directory.
//
// Usage (manual verification):
//   node scripts/ci/check-multirepo-paths.mjs --root tests/fixtures/multirepo
//
// Expected: exit code 1, hit reported at the join() call below.
//
// (The 'tests' directory is whitelisted by default for legitimate test fixtures,
// so an unmodified run against REPO_ROOT will skip this file. The --root override
// is what proves the gate is functional.)

import { join } from 'node:path';

export function intentionallyWrong(dir) {
  // ↓ This is the construction the gate is designed to catch.
  return join(dir, '.wise', 'state', 'fixture.json');
}
